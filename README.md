* About
A multichoice trivia game! The player will have 90 seconds to select one answer choice for each of the questions and submit their answers. After they submit (or time runs out) their score will be tallied and showed (unaswered questions are counted as incorrect guesses). They will then be able to start the game again if they choose.
